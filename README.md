# Problem
Let user input array be ```userArray``` and your array as ```myArray```. After user entered the array check whether ```userArray``` has same values in order and has same length as ```myArray```. 
For example, given ```myArray``` is ```[7, 4, 8, 2]```, if ```userArray``` is ```[7, 4, 8, 2]``` it should return ```true```, if ```userArray``` is ```[8, 5, 7, 2]``` or ```[7, 4, 8, 2, 0]```it should return ```false```
